# Text Editors

[Table of Contents](/hpc_beginning_workshop/)


While you should use a version control system (like Git) for your codes, and you may want to use your own favorite graphical editor, on the server your best bet for spot changes is a text-based editor.

Here are some popular options, all of which are installed on the university research clusters.

## Beginners

### [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/)
A simple text editor that allows users to move the cursor by clicking with the mouse.

The MyAdroit web portal allows users to edit and create files. One can also run interactive sessions using RStudio or Jupyter notebooks. You must be on the campus network or connected by VPN in order to use MyAdroit. To get started choose "Files" from the menu at the top of the page and then "Home Directory".

## Intermediate

### [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)
Nano is a continuation of pico, both of which show a lineage as being a lightweight editor for writing emails. However, it is friendly and has an interface that feels more like a modern text editor. Good first step for short jobs.

## Advanced

### [vi(m)](http://www.vim.org/download.php)
vi and its current iteration that `vi` usually references, vim, is a workhorse editor. It requires a steeper learning curve, but has powerful syntax highlighting that can be activated for programming. There is also a lively plugin community.

### [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
Emacs is a reliable programmer's text editor. Among its features, it can ssh to a server for you, so use it on the cluster and on your own system! Its interface also has a tremendous capacity to be customized with your own config files.
